Resources for Angular Developers

// Nx: An open source toolkit for enterprise Angular applications.
  It extends the native angular cli to help scafold out Ngrx boilerplate & setup
  It also can create "Workspaces" which allow you to have shared npm dependiencies across multiple angular projects to make a mono repo that makes sense for some cases

// Make your Angular App into a cross platform mobile app with NativeScript with two easy steps
    // 1) Inject NativeScript's modified Angular router that conforms to the Angular router Interface, thus no change in routing logic
    // 2) Write new views in NativeScript's tags; all else, components, services, directives, etc... remain the same!
    // 3) Watch out ReactNative ;-p

Introduction to Observables (from Rxjs library) for Angular Developers
https://developer.telerik.com/topics/web-development/introduction-observables-angular-developers/

Rxjs - Observables:

  Rx Marbles: Interactive Design for visualizing how operators (like functions with Observable streams for input/output) work on one or more streams to produce an output stream(s)
